        <h1>What is Quick Recall?</h1>
        <p>Quick Recall is a fast-paced academic competition where teams of students answer questions on a wide range of subjects like math, science, history, literature, and the arts. Players use buzzers to respond quickly, and the goal is to score points by answering correctly before the other team.</p>
        <h1>Basic Rules</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Teams: Each team has 4 players in the game at a time. Coaches can substitute players during timeouts or halftime.</li>
          <li>Match Format: Each  half ends after 10 minutes or 30 questions, whichever comes first. Questions are divided equally among the subject areas.</li>
          <li>Toss-Up Questions: Players have 10 seconds to respond after the question is asked. If a player answers incorrectly, the opposing team is given the opportunity to answer the question.</li>
          <li>Bonus Questions: After a correct toss-up answer, the team receives a bonus question. The team captain may designate another player to answer the bonus, but hesitation or answering by the wrong person results in the bonus being offered to the opposing team.</li>
        </ul>
