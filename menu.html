            <h2>On your turn</h2>
            <p>On your turn, you must click the "start turn" button. Roll a die and move the number of spaces. If you pass a tribe, you must stop on it and roll a dice if you roll above 3, your tribes united counter will go up by one. If you roll a 3 or a 2, you will go backwards by one space. If you roll a 1, the tribe will kill you and you will immediately lose the game</p>
            <h2>How the game ends</h2>
            <p>If you get to the last space on the board in 10 or less turns, you win, but if you have more than 10 turns, you lose.</p>
            <h2>How this game is related to Genghis Kahn</h2>
            <p>Genghis Kahn started as a normal kid named Temujin, he had to bring together many Mongolian tribes to become well known and get the name Genghis Khan.</p>
